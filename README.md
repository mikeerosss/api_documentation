Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) combines deep learning with reinforcement learning. In RL, an agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties. DRL models, like Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and AlphaGo, are used in areas like robotics, game playing, and autonomous systems.
